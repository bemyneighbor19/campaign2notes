When we first went to visit Weshtek, we were surprised by a [[Player Wiki/NPCs/General#Mysterious Mage\|person]] bursting out of Weshtek's house having stolen a map. We chased him down, and Azuria tackled him to the ground to recover the map. He said he had to go and cast dimension door to escape. We went back and talked to Weshtek to hear his story and convinced him to let Mezoar guide us to the map's location (See [[Player Wiki/Events/The Ruby City\|The Ruby City]]).

Mezoar, Weshtek's brother was kidnapped the night before arriving back in Port Nyanzaru after escaping from Fort Beluarian. The [[Player Wiki/NPCs/General#Mysterious Mage\|person]] that kidnapped Mezoar was described as being the same man that tried to steal the map originally: dark clothing, dark brown hair, forgettable face. Additionally, the map was stolen during the kidnapping. The perpetrator used what sounded like a Sleep spell to knock Mezoar out, then used dimension door to get away after grabbing the map. 

Suspicion is currently on Fortuitous Pride. The event lined up with Fortuitous Pride's arrival at the port in search for a guide. Ronnie recalls mentioning Mezoar as the group's guide to the Pride but is unsure if that is related.  Eaton made his presence known at the bathhouse, but without his entourage. Then the three of them went to see Dark Dragon's Descent around the time of the kidnapping. After asking around at Kaya's, it was discovered that Oz stepped out for about 10 minutes or so during the second half of the play to get some air. Winifred recalled meeting the three of them after the show was over.

Azuria timed herself running to Weshtek's house using her full speed and her cloud abilities. She discovered that it took less than a minute (40s) to get to and from Weshtek's place. This included jumping up walls on both legs of the run.
