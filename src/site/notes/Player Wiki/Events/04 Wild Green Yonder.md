There have been three encounters with undead thus far. 
	Once at the Dinosaur Ranch where we met Pingo and Dally, and our new friend Sunset (Sunny) the ankylosaurus.
	Once when Z disturbed a T. Rex Zombie
	Once in the pit where the strange effigy was

In front on an effigy of a man wielding a gem-like dagger was a tribute of gold and rubies covered in dried blood. None of us, including our guide Niar, was able to identify the being. Ronnie was cursed as his strength was sapped and sacrificed to an unknown being when he stole the tribute. This caused the dagger to glow faintly red.
