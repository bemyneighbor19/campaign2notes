## Goliath Tribes

After traveling south for a week or so, we made it to the region where the hill goliaths were said to be. Instead of coming across those, we found ourselves face to face with some mountain trolls that nearly crushed us. After handling them, we stumbled upon the hill goliath tribe, called the Mound Clan, where we delivered the news of Thevia's death.

Z was dumbfounded by the way the different goliaths were treating one another. She said that where she is from, the different clans fight one another, but here they were mingling. She was met by another stone goliath who told her the story of Vaunna Stonedrifter, a goliath from Z's clan back in the Storm Horns, who had died not too long ago. She apparently travelled here about 15 years ago. He pointed us in the direction of the Temple of the Fallen Giants to seek more answers.

There we were gifted with some knowledge of her history through the use of some sort of spirit within the temple.

### Vaunna Stone Drifter
She told of some tensions rising in the Storm Horn clans. Raze and Slate clans, who had shared the Sunset Mountains, had evacuated to the Storm Horns. The response from the other two clans, Crash and Stratus, was hostile, but they begrudgingly gave up some territory since it seemed the intrusion was temporary. When the smoke finally cleared, they were driven out with an unexpected fury. When they returned to the Sunset Mountains, the Raze clan tried expanding their territory. There were several skirmishes that the Slate clan lost, reducing their territory. Then she was exiled when the dust settled.

She left the Slate clan about 6 years after the first eruption of Dark Dragon's Peak, when the smoke cleared from the Sunset Mountains. She never said why, only that she was exiled. She wandered to Baldur's Gate and left because of murder spree. She went to New Elturel and spent some time there before she longed for the mountain air. She found herself within the Cloud Peaks, searching for the goliath clans that she had heard about. She found the Boulder Clan and was accepted in.

We learned that her widower is alive at the Boulder Clan, so we set off to learn more. Thorak was a kind person who welcomed us into his home and shared a meal with us. He told Z that Vaunna knew of the "chosen one" being born but didn't know much more than the history we had gathered. What we did find were a lot of different paintings. The most common subject being painted was a female silhouette surrounded by flames. When asked what they meant, Thorak said that Vaunna used to say, almost like in a trance, "She haunts me. She haunts us all."

## Caught Between Clouds and Crimmor

Once we left the Cloud Peaks, we started our journey to Crimmor. On that path, we came across this "lovely" family who had been attacked by kobolds. They said they were going to Crimmor for the husband's new job. We - Nico and Ronnie mostly- told them all about how we are dead tree hopping to Gambiton and then Orlsfall. We should've seen through their illusions sooner, because of course, it was Fortuitous Pride. 

We got our asses kicked. But not before learning a bit more about these things that are being blocked from our minds. This time it was Iteus, the one associated with masks, and apparently the god that Duldri worships. And Duldri did confirm that he and Ronnie had worked together in the past.

Either way, they said they were going to beat us to our destinations, whether it be both Gambiton and Orlsfall, or just Orlsfall is yet to be seen.

We awoke with all of our gear and items and a new suspicion of groups of three. Altresse is ready to blow their heads up.
