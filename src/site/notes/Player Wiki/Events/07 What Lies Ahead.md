We returned to the Heart of Ubtao after the Ruby City had fallen, where we had a large feast and celebrated Niar's new role as Guardian of Chult and conduit of Ubtao, who seemed to have returned to his land. Bryfina and Nico/Fenvur made a deal so that there would be an alliance with the Emerald Enclave, with Bryfina a little hesitant to pledge her and her tribe as full members to the organization. 

Niar promised us protection from the natural threats of Chult as we returned to Port Nyanzaru, but he requested to stay with his family. So we began our trek back, taking a quick stop at the Firefinger to see what was up in there. We made quick work with some quick thinking, and got was seemed to be all of the treasure and made a hasty exit. 

We soon arrived back in Port Nyanzaru, where we had business to attend to.

## Port Nyanzaru

Here we met with Joval, who we provided a abridged version of the map he requested. We received 450 gold for our hard work, and we seemed to have gained an ally.

Nico went and caught up with Jungle Princess and Vazhul, where they talked about the next dino race and a place for Sunny to stay temporarily. Vazhul entered Nico into the race and with a 100 gold fee, was happy to look after Sunny. Additionally, Nico got a second sponsor from none other than Hunkin' Handpies, who hope to make there little shop an international franchise.

Ronnie was able to broker a deal for the large chunk of raw gold, netting us 27750 gold total. We spent 7750 of it betting on our boy to win the race. After a race MUCH closer than the last, Nico narrowly succeeded, netting us an extra 7750 gold, brining our total wealth to 35500 gold, which we split 4 ways. 

Ronnie and Z set up a book deal, earning Azuria 25% royalties of the book and sole artistic rights for the illustrations, and also got the "keys to the kitchen" of their new manor, a gift from Ootumi for saving her crew's lives.

As the week ended, we boarded the Vicious Fortune and set sail back to Baldur's Gate

## The Vicious Fortune

We learned a few things on the Vicous Fortune as we went about our business. Most importantly, it seems that no one outside our group can hear or read the name Aztoz. It comes out like fuzz. This leaves us with even more questions.

Additionally, Ronnie and Z began learning new skill sets, Smithing and Lockpicking respectfully. Nico made some potions, and Altresse finished copying down some spells. After 2 weeks time, we returned to Baldur's Gate, where the chill in the air is a reminder that it is winter now, and we aren't in sweltering jungles of Chult anymore.
