We returned to the Heart of Ubtao after the Ruby City had fallen, where we had a large feast and celebrated Niar's new role as Guardian of Chult and conduit of Ubtao, who seemed to have returned to his land. Bryfina and Nico/Fenvur made a deal so that there would be an alliance with the Emerald Enclave, with Bryfina a little hesitant to pledge her and her tribe as full members to the organization. 

Niar promised us protection from the natural threats of Chult as we returned to Port Nyanzaru, but he requested to stay with his family. So we began our trek back, taking a quick stop at the Firefinger to see what was up in there. We made quick work with some quick thinking, and got was seemed to be all of the treasure and made a hasty exit. 

We soon arrived back in Port Nyanzaru, where we had business to attend to.

## Port Nyanzaru

Here we met with Joval, who we provided a abridged version of the map he requested. We received 450 gold for our hard work, and we seemed to have gained an ally.

We met with Mezoar and Weshtek, and it seems they are both healthy and happy.

Nico went and caught up with Jungle Princess and Vazhul, where they talked about the next dino race and a place for Sunny to stay temporarily. Vazhul entered Nico into the race and with a 100 gold fee, was happy to look after Sunny. Additionally, Nico got a second sponsor from none other than Hunkin' Handpies, who hope to make there little shop an international franchise.

Ronnie was able to broker a deal for the large chunk of raw gold, netting us 27750 gold total. We spent 7750 of it betting on our boy to win the race. After a race MUCH closer than the last, Nico narrowly succeeded, netting us an extra 7750 gold, brining our total wealth to 35500 gold, which we split 4 ways. 

Ronnie and Z set up a book deal, earning Azuria 25% royalties of the book and sole artistic rights for the illustrations, and also got the "keys to the kitchen" of their new manor, a gift from Ootumi for saving her crew's lives.

As the week ended, we boarded the Vicious Fortune and set sail back to Baldur's Gate

## The Vicious Fortune

We learned a few things on the Vicous Fortune as we went about our business. Most importantly, it seems that no one outside our group can hear or read the name Aztoz. It comes out like fuzz. This leaves us with even more questions.

Additionally, Ronnie and Z began learning new skill sets, Smithing and Lockpicking respectfully. Nico made some potions, and Altresse finished copying down some spells. After 2 weeks time, we returned to Baldur's Gate, where the chill in the air is a reminder that it is winter now, and we aren't in sweltering jungles of Chult anymore.

## Baldur's Gate

We had a lot to do in Baldur's Gate. Our private lives took precedence. We caught up with loved ones and finished off some personal business within the city. Ootumi gave us the keys to the kitchen, and we got to see [[Player Wiki/Collections/The Manor\|The Manor]] we were promised. Its a modest size with room for expansion.

We learned that [[Player Wiki/NPCs/General#Vacien Erascar\|Vacien Erascar]], the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, has connections to a lot of people we keep interacting with. He seems to be the patron of Fortuitous Pride, and a business partner and friend of Rulf Cromwell. He also has connections to the Callaghan family. He claims that he is bringing a new wave of order and justice to Baldur's Gate, saying that he will bring in a golden age for the city.

With a little bit of private investigation work, Z discovered that both she and Ronnie were being watched. It seems to be related to the Fortuitous Pride, but the spies were dealt with. 

Ronnie and Nico used their connections to learn about [[Player Wiki/Collections/The Anguished Ash\|The Anguished Ash]], a tree that follows strife-torn societies, aiding their revengeâ€”only to wither and fall, claimed by nature in the end. They also learned of some cities that have similar black ash trees that follow the similar pattern.

### Gambiton
The town of Gambiton was once a town of miners and farmers. They were a town that was fairly self sufficient and often traded the ores they found with the traders that came through heading South from Keczula to Riatavin along the Gem Road
In 1370 DR, there was a war between the Amnian people and the Sothillisian Empire, which was the ruling empire of the Muranndin region. 
During this war Gambiton was destroyed by a Hill giant/Goblin army that razed it to the ground. The Gambitonians fled North to Esmeltaran where they were protected by their superior defenses.
When they returned 5 years later, the Gambitonians returned to their homes to try to begin anew. Fueled by the anger they felt, they sent a team of people to the Hill giant clan that destroyed their home. A small militia of people was able to take down the clan completely, wiping that clan off the map.
In the years following, in the mountains they took from the hill giants, they found veins of mithril which brought a "mithril rush" of people to Gambiton.
After about 40 years of incredible prosperity for Gambiton, the mithril mines ran dry. Gambiton is now a ghost town.

Gambiton is overgrown, reclaimed by nature, except for the large black ash tree in the center of Gambiton.

### Scornubel

The city of Scornubel is a major stop for trading caravans. It was once split into two towns, Zithia to the South and Reach's End to the North.
The town of Zithia was the wealthier of the two towns. Founded by a mercantile prince from Amn, it had the initial investment that allowed it to propel forward. The poor of Zithia were forced out of town until they founded Reach's End. 
In 1420 DR being emboldened by the feeling of being scorned by the nobles of Zithia, the citizens of Reach's End revolted, laying waste onto Zithia. They razed the city to the ground. The city, now run by those who were once outcasts, adopted the name Scornubel and found prosperity for the coming years. After 40 years, it saw a recession as trade throughout the area saw a reduction of trade as the leader of Elturel blocked off all exterior trade from the regions beyond Elturgard. In an attempt to save its people, Scornubel was annexed by Elturgard in 1465 DR. 
After the fall of Elturel, Scornubel became the defacto capital of Elturgard. 

At the center of old Zithia, which is now a park within Scornubel, stands a large dead ash tree

### Orlsfall

The town of Orlsfall is a small town funded by their gem mines. They are known for their jewelers' guild which is accredited as being the best in Toril. According to descriptions of the town, it has a large black Ash tree in the center of it. 

## Next Steps

With the limited information we have, we made a path to go to Gambiton and Orlsfall after stopping at the Cloud Peaks for Z. The journey will take a couple months, but hopefully we can figure out what in the Hells is going on.
