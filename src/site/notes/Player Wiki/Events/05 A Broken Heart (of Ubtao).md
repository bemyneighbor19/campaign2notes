When we arrived at the Heart of Ubtao, we were welcomed by Bryfina. She showed us around and invited us to the First Flight ceremony. 
At the crack of dawn, the entire tribe went out to watch the aspiring druid scouts try their hand at flight. Nico watched from the top of the heart, which is topped with a tree and a large cluster of golden crystals. All but one of the participants were unable to succeed. One of those who was unsuccessful was Kulin, who seemed hard on himself. Kulin turned out to be Bryfina's great-nephew.

Nico learned about the various flora from Pavo, the plants and healing expert. Pavo identified Ronnie's curse, but he was unable to cure it. Pavo also refilled Nico's healer's kit.
Niar began to train Z in they ways of earth and stone.
While Pavo and Nico were discussing plants, Bryfina pulled Ronnie aside and told him of the unease she was feeling throughout the village. 

After some investigation, it looked like rubies similar to the ones that Ronnie was cursed by were in the possession of the druids who worked with stone. They all looked similarly drained, but they were very proud of their finds. The most ornamented of the masons was Okhun, their leader. 

After some investigation, a mason, Uxin, told Ronnie where they found the rubies, saying that Okhun is there now. Uxin insisted that Okhun would want to speak to Ronnie, since they seemed to have similar goals.

After riding to the location described, we found Okhun's small cavern. There he had a large stash of rubies that were giving off transmutation magic, much like Ronnie's did. Okhun then finds them and shows Ronnie what is down here, a supernatural cluster of incredibly large ruby gemstones.

He tells him that he had heard whispers about a year ago while he was excavating. They were in a version of Chult that he didn't quite understand, but they lead him to this treasure. Not longer after he was visited by the echo of a powerful man, wielding a ruby knife, who offered him wealth and power, to which he accepted.

Okhun told Ronnie that the way to restore his strength is to drain it from someone young and lively, and that Uxin was on his way with such a person.

We quickly left the situation and raced back to the heart where we encountered Uxin carrying Kulin. We promptly dealt with Uxin and returned them back to the Heart.

After debriefing Bryfina, we were interrupted by Okhun returning. After some serious conversations between Okhun and Bryfina, it was decided that Okhun and his "Ruby Grove" would be allowed to leave The Primal Grove freely as long as they were never to return and never attack the Primal Grove. Okhun agreed to these terms. He offered Ronnie one last time to gain the power of the man with the ruby dagger, and when Ronnie declined, Okhun drained the power of the curse out of him much like how a vampire drains blood.

Okhun and his people left the tribe that night. Even though the Primal Grove is safe, there is still a powerful vampire and his kin on the loose. Bryfina was unwilling to start a battle with Okhun to take him down, so she made the best choice for her people.
