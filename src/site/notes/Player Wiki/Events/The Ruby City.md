According to Sten, there is an ancient city within the jungles of Chult. His research points to the name Astua Sangdamas, or the Ruby City. He also suspects that there was a deity that blessed the city with great wealth named Aztoz. The map that guided the expedition of Ootumi seemed to lead to the Redoutgroffe or Valley of Dread, where the city is theorized to be located.

Weshtek originally showed the map to us but it was stolen when Mezoar was kidnapped.

Written on the map is a poem that translates to:

Deep in the jungle passed fields of fire 
the bounty of xxxxxxxxxxxx is shrouded in dread 
He hides his people in shining spires 
And all who search will wind up dead 
He will xxxxxxxxxxx with ancient ire 
Or bless for the price of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

Note: the "x" represent unreadable parts

This is what we seem to remember

## Update: Elient 26th 1528
We have discovered the Ruby City. It seems to be the source of the large magical ruby clusters. 

We found a temple dedicated to the man with the ruby dagger that Weshtek told us about. What we originally thought was "Throw yourself into the fire to enter the city" really translated to "Give your blood to the fire gem (ruby) to open the Gate" after we found the missing piece to the inscription.

We entered the city and were greeted by Nidaasi, a high priestess of Aztoz. She thinks we are Okhun and the Ruby Grove, who she was expecting to show up.

Most of the city is populated with mindless undead, but the intelligent ones seem to be some type of vampire. Nidaasi offered the power of Aztoz to heal our wounds, Altresse and Niar partook and were granted full health and extra power. We have a place to stay for the time being in a nice manor with a handful of rooms. 

Nidaasi told us of the other guests, who turned out to be the three remaining members of the Lost Expedition. Ootumi, Gardon, and Fenvur. Unfortunately, Thevia was killed in the battle when they were kidnapped.

We were told that every 300 years, a ceremony is done on Highharvesttide to reestablish the power of Aztoz throughout Chult. It requires 3 lively sacrifices. According to Nidaasi, the number 3 is very important and powerful in the Aztozian religion. Additionally, we were told of Itakulo, the prophet and conduit to Aztoz. It was also mentioned that a Ruby Dagger seems to be the powerful relic that Ootumi was after. 

Right now, we are trying to move quickly so that Okhun doesn't show up and blow our cover.

Our current theory is that we are in some sort of demiplane with no exit. According to the stories we were told, the maze's exits were sealed when Ubtao left Chult. We initially thought it was in reference to the afterlife, but it seems to have been a double entendre. The exits of the city were sealed as well, although Nidaasi did mention with the new power of Okhun joining forces with the Ruby City, that there were "big plans" for the future.

With all this talk of mazes, Nico discovered that the city used to have a maze, but the structure of it was torn down long ago, and they made a shortcut to the large ruby ziggurat that looms over the city. We tried to enlist the help of Zedd to find the maze, but he instead found some popcorn.... from somewhere..... Luckily Nico thought to use his ring as a map to find the true maze. Maybe it will lead us to an exit, or some answers.
