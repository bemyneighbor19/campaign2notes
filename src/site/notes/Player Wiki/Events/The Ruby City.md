According to Sten, there is an ancient city within the jungles of Chult. His research points to the name Astua Sangdamas, or the Ruby City. He also suspects that there was a deity that blessed the city with great wealth named Aztoz. The map that guided the expedition of Ootumi seemed to lead to the Redoutgroffe or Valley of Dread, where the city is theorized to be located.

Weshtek originally showed the map to us but it was stolen when Mezoar was kidnapped.

Written on the map is a poem that translates to:

Deep in the jungle passed fields of fire 
the bounty of xxxxxxxxxxxx is shrouded in dread 
He hides his people in shining spires 
And all who search will wind up dead 
He will xxxxxxxxxxx with ancient ire 
Or bless for the price of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
