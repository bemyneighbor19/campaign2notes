An archaeological/treasure hunting team lead by Eaton Alistair. It is truly an *honor* to be accepted into their ranks.

# Eaton "His Majesty" Alistair

![Eaton His Majesty Alistair.jpg|400](/img/user/Portraits/Eaton%20His%20Majesty%20Alistair.jpg)

Eaton is a rival explorer to [[Player Wiki/NPCs/Lost Expedition#Ootumi\|Ootumi]] who claims that she was a part Eaton's crew back in the day
Eaton and the rest of Fortuitous Pride are going after the same thing Ootumi was.
Their home base in Chult is Fort Beluarian.

Note: *His Majesty* is a pompous ass who can't even get our names right half the time

# Oz

Oz is a Chultan sorcerer that is part of Fortuitous Pride. She seems to be the most level headed of the group.

# Duldri Bearleaf

Duldri is a human paladin of Mystra that is part of Fortuitous Pride. He is mysterious and a man of few words. We can't always recall what he looks like other than the stripe in his hair.
