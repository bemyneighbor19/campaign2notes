# Erascar Family
## Vacien Erascar

Grand Duke in Baldur's Gate
Superior of Liara of the Flaming Fist battalion at Fort Beluarian
Seems to be working with the Cromwell and Callaghan families to gain more power within Baldur's Gate. 
He also appears to be the patron of Fortuitous Pride

## Others
Royden Erascar - Son

# Cromwell Family
## Rulf Cromwell

Father of Rosa Cromwell
Employer of Olgo Stonesworn (bodyguard)
Owner of Cromwell Zoological Industries and works in animal trading
Nobility within Baldur's Gate

We heard from Arin that Rulf might have been the person who got Sten "taken care of." Rulf seems to be looking to push for exotic animal trading from Port Nyanzaru and to broker a deal with Ifan, the Merchant Prince that controls such things.

## Others
Rosa Cromwell - daughter

# Callaghan Family
## Ludos Callaghan

Head of the Callaghan Family
