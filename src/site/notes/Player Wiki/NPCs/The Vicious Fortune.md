**Crew (MAIN):**  
The captain, **Almira Gail**, has seen it all. She allegedly has been through dragon turtle attacks, undersea volcanic eruptions, and red dragon raids. Her pale blue skin and white hair scream Air Genasi, and the way she seems to float across the deck would have you believe that she is harmless, but a scrap with her would likely see you flung off the ship in a burst of wind or slashed through by her rapier.

Her first mate, the halfling **Saydin**, is the spitting image of ruggedness, just shrunk down a size. He has a scar across his face that he says he got when escaped a lord of Calimport. His burly nature is a sign of his brute strength. Not many halflings can wield a greataxe.

The cook of the ship, **Teron**, is actually a Chultan who they met in Port Nyanzaru. His skills in the kitchen are unmatched by any other cook you have met… on a ship… that takes a month long journey to and from a city on a untamed island.  


Finally, the quartermaster and weapons expert on the ship, **Up** and **Up**, rock gnome artificer twins who left their mountain dwelling behind to enjoy the open seas. Up is a master of his craft; he tinkers with gadgets, tracks the supplies and maintains the hull of the ship. Up blows things up, preferably enemies.

**Crew (EXTRA)**:
- Azuria Skyclimber (Megan PC)
- Torry (tiefling female)
- Ben Wheatflow (human male)
- Begos Aldaviel (half elf male)
- Arin Hardcloak (human male)
