The Primal Grove is the a tribe of druids within Chult that Nico was seeking. They pointed him in the direction of the Valley of Dread to find what he is looking for and offered the group a guide to take them there. The only thing they asked for was the Tooth of Ubtao that Fort Beluarian had taken. 

The main location of the Grove is near the Heart of Ubtao within Chult.

If the group wants to take the grove up on their offer, they can meet them at the location on the shore of the Bay of Chult that Golin pointed out.
