The Primal Grove is the a tribe of druids within Chult that Nico was seeking. 

After being ambushed by Golin, we were taken to a small temporary outpost for the Grove to meet Bryfina. We learned that the main location of the Grove is near the Heart of Ubtao within Chult. 

They really like to use ptiny pterodactyls to spy and occasionally bombard the fort with poop. They pointed us in the direction of the Valley of Dread to find what he is looking for and offered us a guide to take them there.  After asking about people with red masks, we were told that some of the older druids would speak of the inhabitants of that ancient city wearing such masks. The only thing they asked for in return of the information was the Tooth of Ubtao that Fort Beluarian had taken. 

If we want to take the grove up on their offer for a guide, we can meet them at the location on the shore of the Bay of Chult that Golin pointed out.
