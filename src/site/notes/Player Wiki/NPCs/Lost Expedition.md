This expedition was led by Ootumi in search for something powerful or unique at the location described by the map. Weshtek returned claiming they were attacked when they reached what they thought was the final destination. Weshtek was seriously injured and is still recovering by the time the group arrives in Port Nyanzaru.

**Eleint 26th 1528:** Ootumi is alive along with Gardon and Fenvur. They are being held captive by the Aztozians in order to be used as a sacrifice on Highharvesttide (in 5 days).

# Ootumi

Half-Orc Explorer famous for discovering the Golden Fist, an ancient glove giving its wearer reality altering power; the Mask of the Emerald Dragon, a mask that gives the wearer the powers of an Emerald Dragon; and the Scepter of the Great Old One, a staff that gives its user an ambiguous dark gift. All these adventures were archived as very popular novels.


# Weshtek

Chultan human guide for the expedition. He was the only one to make it back to Port Nyanzaru to spread the tale of what had happened. He was seriously injured. 

His story:
“Thevia, Fenvalur, Gardon, and I sailed to the ruins of Ishau, where we joined up with Ootumi. She provided me with the map, and I used what I could to navigate through the jungle towards the Valley of Dread. It had taken us farther than I had ever gone within the valley. We were mostly concerned with the monsters in the area and narrowly avoided encounters with the snakefolk. We had started to become disheartened after nearly two weeks of carving our way through the jungle, only to find an abandoned temple. Gardon was convinced this was the destination since it emitted a strong magical aura, and Ootumi was determined to search the temple in hopes that a powerful artifact was hidden within. We made camp for the night and planned to delve into the temple the following morning. Only, there wasn’t a following morning for them. I awoke to the sounds of screaming. We were ambushed in the middle of the night by a band humanoid figures in bright red masks.  We didn’t stand a chance. I did the only thing I could and ran before they got to me. After a month of scavenging and narrowly surviving several close encounters with the monsters of Chult, I found my way back to Ishau and took our boat to Nyanzaru so that I could share their story.”
