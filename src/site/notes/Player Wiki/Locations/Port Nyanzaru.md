# Bathhouse

This is where you can find a nice bath or a steamy sauna. You can also find Kriistbodrem here as well.

# Kaya's House of Repose

You can catch dinner and a show here. They put on Dark Dragon's Descent every night from 8pm to 11pm starring Winifred Mistspitter as Senna. 

We haven't met the owner or workers of Kaya's yet.
