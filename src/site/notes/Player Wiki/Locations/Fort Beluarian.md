Run by the Flaming Fist, this stronghold sits on the northern outshoot off the Bay of Chult. It's' captain, [[Player Wiki/NPCs/General#Liara Portyr\|Liara Portyr]], is a proud and stern leader who wants to get out of Chult, but she will do her duty no matter what. 

They have a mine in the mountains to the north that we have yet to see, but that is where they discover the Tooth of Ubtao.

Fortuitous Pride has a home base here at request of their patron until they set out on their expedition.
