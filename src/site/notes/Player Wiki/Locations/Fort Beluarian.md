_The flag of Baldur’s Gate flies over this wooden stockade. The whole structure sits atop a 10-foot hillock, the sides of which are shaved vertically to make them steep and difficult to climb. The fort’s main gate faces west. On the east side of the stockade, a tall keep holds a commanding view of the surrounding wilderness._

# Notes
Run by the Flaming Fist, this stronghold sits on the northern outshoot off the Bay of Chult. It's' captain, [[Player Wiki/NPCs/General#Liara Portyr\|Liara Portyr]], is a proud and stern leader who wants to get out of Chult, but she will do her duty no matter what. 

They have a mine in the mountains to the north that we have yet to see, but that is where they discovered the Tooth of Ubtao.

Fortuitous Pride has a home base here at request of their patron until they set out on their expedition.
