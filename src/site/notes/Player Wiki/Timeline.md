**1486 DR** - The Elturel Crater is formed, and quickly becomes Elturel Crater Lake.
**1498 DR** – A portal opens above Waterdeep, and a fleet of Mindflayers attempt to invade  
**1498 DR** – Shimmergloom falls. The Well of Dragons Caldera erupts and gains the name Dark Dragon’s Peak. The eruption causes the residents of towns in the surrounding region to evacuate west towards Baldur’s Gate, east towards Cormyr, or north towards Evereska. Black clouds fill the region’s sky for the next 6 years expanding to the edge of The Reaching Wood and trapped by the Storm Horns.  
**1499 DR** – The Undermountain sees a surge of activity causing the Yawning Portal to become more vigilant than usual. With this activity comes a "golden age" for the Yawning Portal.
**1500 DR** - The Temple of Bahamut is erected within Waterdeep. Holyhand's House is expanded to become the largest orphanage in the Waterdavian area, providing the best for the orphans that need it.
**1500 DR** – Castle Neverwinter is completed, and the city’s funding is then put towards renovating the Scar district of the town. Neverneath Dungeon remains wild and untamed, but she is always thankful for the people that removed her aberrant inhabitants.
**1500 DR** – Waterdeep invests in protections against extraplanar threats with the help from the professionals that have experienced such threats.
**1502 DR** – The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast establish the Dragon’s Horde, a faction of metallic dragons and followers of Bahamut whose duty is to prevent the rise of another evil draconic deity. They have ambassadors in each major city within the Sword Coast and work closely with the other factions to identify and eradicate potential draconic cults.  
**1503 DR** – The town New Elturel is founded along the coast of Lake Elturel.  
**1505 DR** – Silverymoon is considered completely rebuilt and the mythal surrounding the city is recreated, but the Moonbridge is still gone. A physical bridge (Moon’s Rest Crossing) is built in memoriam of those lost in the Siege of Silverymoon.  
**1508 DR** - There are a series of gruesome unsolved murders within Baldur's Gate. These murders unknowingly stop after 6 months.
**1510 DR** – Dark Dragon’s Peak erupts a second time. The extreme tectonic activity in the area sunders a large portion of the Sunset Mountains. The skies in the region blacken again for another 5 years. The volcano hasn’t erupted since, but it is still considered active.  
**1528 DR** – Ootumi’s exploration goes missing. Weshtek returns towards the end of Flamerule (Month 7/12)  


The adventuring party leaves Velen at the end of summer and arrives in Port Nyanzaru on the first of Elient (Month 9/12) of 1528 DR.
