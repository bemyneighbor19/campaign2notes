About a year ago (Highharvesttide DR 1527 ): 
"This evening I made a interesting discovery. During a scouting dig looking for large sections of bedrock to extract, I began to hear voices beckoning me. They promised me wealth, and I physically couldn't resist. I am glad I did not. I was led to a deposit of incredibly large rubies. They were overflowing with magical potential. I am currently working on a way to extract them to see how we can use their magic like we do with the Heart." 

The next entry (Leaffall 3 DR 1527): 
"During this last visit, I was visited by the ghost of a man wielding a ruby knife. He and I discussed what I had stumbled upon. This echo of him seemed only to be a fraction of his true power. He offered me the power of wealth, and the magic to grow it. I was resistant at first, but he showed me what this power could bring me and the tribe in places like Port Nyanzaru, so I accepted the offer. Once the blood was spilled, I found that the mundane rocks that I have spent my life understanding were so easily changed to the most precious of gemstones." 

About 3 months after (Midwinter DR 1528): 
"I do not know the name of my benefactor, but he is requesting more followers. I have reached out to a few more masons, and they eventually saw the power I was offering them. It seems that our patron is drawing some energy from these gems we create, but we have been stockpiling. These rubies are worth the slight weakness we feel." 

About 2 months ago (Midsummer DR 1528): 
"I have begun to feel like an outcast with the grove. Our patron has let us know that if we want ultimate power, we need to claim the Heart for him. Use our power to change the gold of Ubtao to red. This is the beginning of the Ruby Grove." 

Most Recent Entry (The Fading 17 DR 1528): 
"Feeding our energy to our patron has left us all starving for something more, me more than the others. He requires more of me as I am his prophet. Alas, I need to feed on something more than just the remains of animals and plants. He told me, that if I was to continue to serve him, I would need to drain the energy of someone lively and young. I have sent Uxin to get such a person."
