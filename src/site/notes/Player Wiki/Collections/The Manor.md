**Order:** Craft

An Arcane Study is a place of quiet research that contains one or more desks and bookshelves.

The Charm allows you to cast [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify) without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.

**_Craft Options._** When you issue the [Craft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/bastions#Craft) order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

**Craft: Arcane Focus.** You commission the facility’s hireling to craft an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus). The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in your Bastion until you claim it.

See the “[Crafting Magic Items](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#CraftingMagicItems)” section in [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure) for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item.
