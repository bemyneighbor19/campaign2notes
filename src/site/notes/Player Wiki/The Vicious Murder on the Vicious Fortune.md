The murder of Sten Morkez happened during the night of the sahaguin attack aboard the Vicious Fortune. After some sleuthing, it was narrowed down to one suspect, Arin Hardcloak. After confirming his guilt with a Speak with Dead spell cast on the deceased Sten and two Zone of Truth spell provided by Duldri Bearleaf, Arin was placed in jail by Almira. 

Later that night, Arin "escaped" and fled to Port Nyanzaru. 

Eventually, Arin would run into Azuria again and tell her of the events that happened before the murder took place. This is where Arin overheard Rulf talking about a plan that Sten was getting in the way of and how he would be taken care of.

There are still unanswered questions revolving around the murder.
